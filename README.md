## Description
Alpha faces challenges in managing banking operations, resulting in inefficient processes and information security vulnerabilities. Customers demand more agile and secure services in the digital age. Current operational methods, largely dependent on manual processes, are slow and error-prone, compromising Alpha's competitiveness in an increasingly digitized and regulated financial market.

The main objective is to develop and implement a modular, end-to-end banking system solution for Alpha. This solution will not only optimize banking operations, but also strengthen information security and improve the customer experience, thus aligning with market expectations and complying with current regulations.

The need to transform Alpha's banking operations is evident in the face of today's operational and strategic challenges. Implementing an advanced technology solution will enable Alpha to overcome current limitations by reducing reliance on manual processes and increasing accuracy and security in account and loan management. In addition, the proposed solution will substantially improve customer satisfaction and meet regulatory requirements, enabling Alpha to compete effectively in an evolving marketplace.

The modules identified for this system are essential for the integrated management of banking operations. Each module addresses specific aspects, from account management to information security. This modular architecture will allow for greater flexibility and scalability in the development and maintenance of the system.

## Modules

The modules identified for this system are the following:

- Manage Accounts Module
- Analyze Loan Opportunities Module
- Loan Granting Module
- Loan Tracking Module
- Loan Recovery Module
